ABSTRACT = {Using seismic data, logging information, geological interpretation data, and petrophysical data, it is possible to estimate the stratigraphic texture and elastic parameters of a study area via a seismic inversion. As such, a seismic inversion is an indispensable tool in the field of oil and gas exploration and development. However, due to unknown natural factors, seismic inversions are often ill-conditioned problems. One way to work around this unknowable information is to determine the solution to the seismic inversion using regularization methods after adding further a priori constraints. In this study, the nonconvex L1−2 regularization method is innovatively applied to the three-parameter prestack amplitude variation angle (AVA) inversion. A forward model is first derived based on the Fatti approximate formula and then low-frequency models for P impedance, S impedance, and density are established using logging and horizon data. In the Bayesian inversion framework, we derive the objective function of the prestack AVA inversion. To further improve the accuracy and stability of the inversion results, we remove the correlations between the elastic parameters that act as initial constraints in the inversion. Then, the objective function is solved by the nonconvex L1−2 regularization method. Finally, we validate our inversion method by applying it to synthetic and observational data sets. The results show that our nonconvex L1−2 regularization seismic inversion method yields results that are highly accurate, laterally continuous, and can be used to identify and locate reservoir formation boundaries. Overall, our method will be a useful tool in future work focused on predicting the location of reservoirs.},
